Concepts to explore:
- Possibly partial turn-based system and partial standard 2-D fighter system.
- Adventure mode revolving around portal concept from class (Portal = jump to different universe)?
- Adventure mode revolving around universes crossing. Link characters from different shows together?
- Adventure mode is 360 degrees eventually with Arkham-style fighting system for henchmen,
but turn-based style for large-scale battles, with 2-D fighter system for 1v1s. Boss battle = mixture of all types.
