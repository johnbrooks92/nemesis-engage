My first attempt at video game development. !Still under construction!

Nemesis: Engage is a game inspired by some of my favorite games of the past. The foundation is a turn-based, 2-D RPG battle game along the lines of the Pokemon battle systems. With inspiration from flash game fighter classics like Etherena Beta and others, I aim to make this title a competitive battle system and implement my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS to this point to clean up the functionality and reduce code length, but still give a viable product that has elements of skill, luck and nostalgia.

Enjoy and kick some butt!
